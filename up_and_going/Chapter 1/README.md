### Chapter 1 : Into Programming

The goal of this exercise is to creat a simple program that takes the user's input to assign bank_balance, then calculates the price of phones and accesories based on criteria set by the book.  From there, it checks whether the user has enough money to purchase the selected items and prints the remaining bank balance.
